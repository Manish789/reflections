What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialing a repository creates a git repository. It helps in keeping track of the changes we will be doing
during the course of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

Commit is applied on staging area. All the files present in staging area will be part of the repository.
It offers the flexibility of which files to be added to Git repository and when, keeping it simple to separate
unrelated changes/additions.
