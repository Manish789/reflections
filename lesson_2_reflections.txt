What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialing a repository creates a git repository. It helps in keeping track of the changes we will be doing
during the course of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

Commit is applied on staging area. All the files present in staging area will be part of the repository.
It offers the flexibility of which files to be added to Git repository and when, keeping it simple to separate
unrelated changes/additions.

How can you the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Whenever changes are made to files in the working directory, each independent change can only be added to
staging area and then commit can be performed making it easier to add one commit per logical change in
the Git Repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would brances
help?

Branches can be helpful when the team is working on different releases and need to maintain separate track for
each release making it easier to backtrack.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams are helpful as it gives clear structure of what exactly is going on within the project.
